# Practice Problem 1.1

## Problem

Calculate the amount of charge represented by 10 billion protons.

## Solution

The charge of a proton is $1.6021\times10^{-19}\;C$. Hence 10 billions ($10^{10}$) protons will have
the total amount of charge equal to $1.6021\times10\;C^{-19}\times10^{10}=1.6021\times10^{-9}\;C$.

**Answer:** $1.6021*10^{-9}\;C$.
