# Practice Problem 1.1

## Problem

We shall calculate the amount of charge represented by 10 billion protons.

## Solution

The charge of a proton is $1.6021\times10^{-19}$ C.

We can hence calculate the amount of charge of 10 billions (same as $10^{10}$) by just multiplying the charge of a proton and number of protons.

$$1.6021\times10^{-19}\times10^{10}=1.6021\times10^{-9}$$

**Answer:** $1.6021\times10^{-9}$ C.
