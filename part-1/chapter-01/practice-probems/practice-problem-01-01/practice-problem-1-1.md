# Practice Problem 1.1

## Problem

We need to calculate the amount of charge represented by 10 billion protons.

## Solution

It is stated in the book that charge of a single proton is $1.602\times10^{-19}$ C. But more exactly the charge is $1.6021\times10^{-19}$ C, and we will use this number in our calculations.

We can calculate the amount of charge of 10 billions protons by just multiplying the charge of a single proton by 10 billions:

$$1.6021\times10^{-19}\times10^{10}=1.6021\times10^{-9}$$

**Answer:** $1.6021\times10^{-9}$ C.
