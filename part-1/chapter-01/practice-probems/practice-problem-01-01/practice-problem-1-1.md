# Practice Problem 1.1

## Problem

Calculate the amount of charge represented by 10 billion protons.

## Solution

The charge of a proton is $ 1.6021 * 10^-19 $ C. Hence 10 billions ($10^10$) protons will have
the total amount of charge $ 1.6021 C * 10^-19 * 10^10 = 1.6021 * 10^-9 C $.

**Answer** $ 1.6021 * 10^-9 C $.
