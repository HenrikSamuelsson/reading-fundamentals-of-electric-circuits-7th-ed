# Practice Problem 1.1

## Problem

We shall calculate the amount of charge represented by 10 billion protons.

## Solution

It is stated in the book that charge of a single proton is $1.602\times10^{-19}$ C. But we will use value with one more decimal, $1.6021\times10^{-19}$ C. Reason being that our final answer will otherwise not match the answer presented in the book.

Knowing the charge of a proton we can calculate the amount of charge of 10 billion protons by just multiplying the charge of a single proton by 10 billion. Note that 10 billion can be written as $10^{10}$ and this format is used in the below calculation.

$$1.6021\times10^{-19}\times10^{10}=1.6021\times10^{-19+10}=1.6021\times10^{-9}$$

### Answer

$1.6021\times10^{-9}$ C
